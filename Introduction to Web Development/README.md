![banner](banner.jpg)

Welcome to SAIS Hack Club's Introduction to Web Development project! This project is designed to teach you the basics of web development, and to help you build your first website. This project is divided into 3 parts:

- [Section 0: Getting Started](./Section_0/Lesson_1_Getting_Started.md)
- [Section 1: Shipping Your First Website](./Section_1/Lesson_1_Intro_to_HTML.md)
- Section 2: Adding Interactivity with JavaScript (coming soon!)
- Section 3: Going Further with React (coming soon!)

## What is the end product?

At the end of this project, you'll have a fully functional website that you can share with your friends and family. You'll be able to add new pages to your website, and it will be all about you! You'll be able to add a picture of yourself, your favorite hobbies, and more. You'll also be able to add a contact form to your website, so that people can contact you.

## What will I learn?

In this project, you'll learn the basics of web development, including:

- How to use HTML to create a website
- How to use CSS to style your website, and use Bootstrap to "theme" your website
- How to use JavaScript to add interactivity to your website (coming soon!)

Then, we will move on to learning about React, which is a popular JavaScript framework that is used to build websites. We will re-create your website using React, and you'll learn why it's so popular. 👀

## How do I get started?
