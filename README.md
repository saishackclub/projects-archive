## What is SAIS Hack Club?

SAIS Hack Club is a student-led coding club at Stamford American International School, Singapore. We meet every week to learn how to code and build cool projects together. We also host workshops, hackathons, and other events throughout the year.

## What is this repository?

This repository contains all of the projects that we've worked on over the years. We've organized them into projects. Each project has its own README.md file that contains a description of the project and sections for each lesson.

## How do I contribute?

## How do I get started?

If you're new to coding, we recommend starting with our [Introduction to Web Development](Introduction%20to%20Web%20Development/README.md) project. If you're already familiar with web development, you can start with any of the other projects.

## How do I get help?
